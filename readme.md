## About the project

Once, when I was talking to a friend, he mentioned that he was working on a complicated spreadsheet
to help in accounting of many employees from picking crops. I found it could be done better without Excel.

> This repository only stores the backend part of the application.
> Work on the frontend part is in progress with the use of Angular framework.

Main features of the application are:

* Storing the list of employees along with contact details
* Quick search for employees with the use of QR codes
* Management of tasks completed by employees with
  * Location/place of work
  * Type of work
  * Quantity, unit of measure and rate for the performed unit of work
* Defining work types with a billing unit and default rates
* Creating new staff accounts
* Storing information about employees' insurance policies
* Payroll management with the current balance of earnings for each employee
* Generating reports on the work performed on a given field or employee in XLS format

## Roadmap

- [x] Sending emails with QR codes
- [x] Add CI support
- [ ] Add CD support
- [ ] Implement logging mechanism
- [ ] Implement notifications of the near end of the insurance policy
- [ ] Enabling employees to log in to check their work statistics
- [ ] Test the application in the real world

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Java JRE
* PostgreSQL server running locally
* Docker for Testcontainers

### Quick start

Harvest is a Spring Boot application built using Maven. You can run it locally in four simple steps:

1. Create user and database (PostgreSQL)

```roomsql
  CREATE ROLE harvest WITH
	LOGIN
	NOSUPERUSER
	NOCREATEDB
	NOCREATEROLE
	INHERIT
	NOREPLICATION
	CONNECTION LIMIT -1
	PASSWORD 'harvest';
  CREATE DATABASE harvest WITH 
    OWNER = harvest
    ENCODING = 'UTF8'
    CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
```

2. Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ado999/harvest.git
```

3. Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd harvest
```

4. Start the application

```bash
  ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev,no-mail
```

Application by default starts on port 8080. The Swagger UI page should be available
on [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html). Default credentials
are`janusz@admin.qp:janusz`
> * If you prefer to test application with mail service enabled then refer to [Mail configuration](#Mail-configuration)
> * Unless Docker environment is running on your machine you may also want to use `-DskipTests=true` option in run commm

## API

Endpoints, request bodies and parameters are described in a separate [file](api.md).

## Profiles

Profiles provide an easy way to segregate parts of application configuration. Currently implemented are:

* dev - Contains script for populating the DB with sample data (active by default)
* prod - Profile created for production
* test - Configures DB connection using Testcontainers
* no-mail - Disables sending emails

## Mail configuration

Application requires SMTP credentials if "no-mail" profile is not active. This can be done by:

* Creating "secrets.yml" file in resources directory:

```yml
spring:
  mail:
    username: <your-mail-username>
    password: <your-mail-password>
```

Or

* Providing VM arguments at application startup:

```bash
java ... -Dspring.mail.username=<your-mail-username> -Dspring.mail.password=<your-mail-password>
```
